      overview: "Worked as a UI/UX developer for about 3 years on new features and enhancements as well as maintaining the existing codebase of PartnerlinQ, an EDI platform used by various international partners for onboarding and exchanging data. The platform had multiple internal portals all with their own functionality and user experience requirements.",
      challenge: "Since it was an evolving product with multiple internal portals, there was always the issue of increasing design inconsistencies and user confusion. The goal was to create a unified design system that could be used across all portals, ensuring a consistent user experience. There was significant design burden with global styling reaching thousands of lines across multiple platforms rather than a unified design system. Using Material UI and Angular Material also added on significant complexity with multiple design overrides needed as per changing design requirements.",
      solution: "Replaced Material UI and Angular Material with PrimeNG to create a more consistent and maintainable design system. Developed a custom design system that could be used across all portals, ensuring a unified user experience. Created custom utility classes using mixins mimicing Tailwind functionality since completely removing Bootstrap was not part of current scope. Reworked all components' reusability and modularity to reduce design burden and improve maintainability. Moving to PrimeNG also allowed us to shift the design towards a more modern style, aligning with current design trends.",

      challenge: "The modifier screen was very flat as opposed to the modern design standards. The action button placement was not intuitive and neither was the item selection and listing. The goal was to redesign the screen to improve usability and reduce complexity. The item details were also not very clear and in dark mode the text was not very readable.",
      solution: "Rework the whole design of the screen to fit modern UI/UX standards. I looked towards different design inspirations for POS systems and came up with a color scheme that would clearly highlight selections and errors. Since this was a POS screen the flow had to be fast with minimal interruptions, so I focused on making the action buttons more prominent and intuitive. The item selection was also made more clear with better spacing and item details. The dark mode was also improved with better contrast and readability.",

The parents in the list are collapsible accordions to avoid clutter when modifying a certain order with clear border divisions. The complete order button has also been made more prominent and visible as opposed to a small tick button on the bottom right corner in the previous design.",
